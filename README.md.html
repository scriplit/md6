<h1>md6</h1>

<p>Alternative markdown parser in Perl6</p>

<h1>What &amp; why</h1>

<p>This is basically the embryo of a Perl6 grammar which parses a relatively small subset of Markdown. The purpose is more to learn and exercise Perl6 grammars than to build a really 100% complying and useful parser.</p>

<h1>How</h1>

<p><code>perl6 -I lib bin/markdown README.md</code></p>
