Alternative markdown parser in Perl6

What & why
===

This is basically the embryo of a Perl6 grammar which parses a relatively
small subset of Markdown. The purpose is more to learn and exercise Perl6
grammars than to build a really 100% complying and useful parser.

How
===

`perl6 -I lib bin/markdown README.md`
